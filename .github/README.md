# Contextualized Human Understanding for Drinks and Eating Pattern

An AI-powered drink suggestion system that detects a person's age and mood from their face, then suggests a personalized drink ratio.

## Project Overview

**Goal**: Just like your mom cooks food by seeing your face and your mood lightens up, our AI tells you a drink to drink!

**Working Flow**:
1. Image capture → Detect person's mood and age
2. Suggest user a drink ratio (7 flavored liquids)
3. Machine with 7 pumps mixes the drink
4. User rates (1-10) → System learns and improves

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Prepare Datasets

- **FER2013**: Download from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) → Place in `data/fer2013/`
- **UTKFace**: Download from [UTKFace](https://susanqq.github.io/UTKFace/) → Place in `data/utk/`
- **Drinks Dataset**: Create `data/drinks.csv` with columns: `gender,age,mood,drink`

### 3. Train Models

```bash
# Train Model 1 (Age + Mood Detection)
python src/train_model1.py

# Train Model 2 (Drink Suggestion)
python src/train_model2.py
```

### 4. Run Application

```bash
python run_project.py
```

## Usage

1. Position your face in front of camera
2. Press `c` to capture → System detects age and mood
3. System suggests drink ratios (7 bottles)
4. Rate the drink (1-10) → Feedback saved automatically
5. System fine-tunes after every 10 ratings

## Models

- **Model 1**: CNN with dual outputs (age regression + mood classification)
- **Model 2**: MLP for drink suggestion with feedback learning
